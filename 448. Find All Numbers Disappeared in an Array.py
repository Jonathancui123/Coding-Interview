# CYCLIC SORT, ARRAY

# Ex 1: [3,3,3] -> [1,2]

'''
O(n^2) time [brute] : For each number in [1, n], check if it is in nums. If it is not, add it to the output list
O(n) time, O(n) space [set]: Create a set initialized to contain [1,n] and remove each element that we see in nums. 
    Or use a boolean list of size n initialized to False, and set index i - 1 to true if i is found/
    We go through the set or the list and populate the final solution
O(n) time, O(1) 'extra' space: Cyclic sort to put each number, i, into index i-1. If the duplicate already exists in i-1, let it rest in the current position --> Each index will hold the number (index + 1) if (index + 1) exists.
    Iterate through nums and find indices that don't hold index + 1
